PLAKAR-MOUNT(1) - General Commands Manual

# NAME

**plakar-mount** - Mount Plakar snapshots as read-only filesystem

# SYNOPSIS

**plakar&nbsp;mount**
\[**-to**&nbsp;*mountpoint*]
\[*snapshotID*]

# DESCRIPTION

The
**plakar mount**
command mounts a Plakar repository snapshot as a read-only filesystem
at the specified
*mountpoint*.
This allows users to access snapshot contents as if they were part of
the local file system, providing easy browsing and retrieval of files
without needing to explicitly restore them.
This command may not work on all Operating Systems.

In addition to the flags described below,
**plakar mount**
supports the location flags documented in
plakar-query(7)
to precisely select snapshots.

The options are as follows:

**-to** *mountpoint*

> Specify the mount location.
> The
> *mountpoint*
> can either be:

> *	A directory path for FUSE mounts

> *	An HTTP address including port for remote mounting (e.g.,
> 	'`http://hostname:8080`')

> If not specified, mount will attempt a FUSE mount in the working directory with
> a random subdirectory name.

*snapshotID*

> Optional.
> Specifies which snapshot to mount.
> If not provided, all snapshots are mounted.

# EXAMPLES

Mount all snapshots to a local directory:

	$ plakar mount -to ~/mnt

Mount the latest snapshot to a local directory:

	$ plakar mount -to ~/mnt -latest

Mount a specific snapshot by ID to a directory:

	$ plakar mount -to ~/mnt abc123

Mount snapshots matching a filter (e.g., snapshots with tag "daily-backup"):

	$ plakar mount -to ~/mnt -tag daily-backup

Mount a snapshot to an HTTP endpoint:

	$ plakar mount -to http://hostname:8080

Mount a specific snapshot to an HTTP endpoint:

	$ plakar mount -to http://hostname:8080 abc123
